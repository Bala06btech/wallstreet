## Let's follow the money
My friend and I always wanted to play around with Wallstreet data and see if we can get some insights, ok as usual started googling for dataset and end up getting from Kaggle. 
Specifically we wanted understand which stocks were popular among fund managers. 

### Total Funds
After quick clean up and initial data parsing end up with total number of funds, a whopping **23355** funds are available in our dataset.

Now comes to the initial question which stocks are loved by the all the fund managers irrespective of their fund status.
